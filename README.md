# GDI-ffmpeg

This is a Swift package wrapper for [ffmpegkit](https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit). This is not a complete implementation and is built only to sufficiently meet the needs I have for integration with `FFmpegKit`. I do not provide support for this project or taking requests to add additional functionality. 

## Version
This package is currently using `FFmpegKit` 4.5.1 Native with the `https` package configuration.
